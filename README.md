### Lessons Learned

  I learned A LOT about inheritance and encapsulation through the entirety of the creation of this application. I truly believe I gained a genuine amount of understand involving the two.

  I learned how difficult UML diagrams can be to create, but the creation of my diagram helped me significantly during my brainstorming process.
